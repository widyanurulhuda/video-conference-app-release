Original Mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Original Mode provides a complete **360-degree view** captured by a fisheye camera, displaying the original, unmodified video feed in a circular layout. This mode is designed to show the entire meeting room in one continuous frame, ensuring that no participant or activity is left out of view. It captures every angle within the space, making it especially useful in hybrid or remote meetings where attendees need full visibility of the physical room and everyone in it. This eliminates the need to manually adjust or switch between multiple cameras during the session.
For users, Original Mode enhances situational awareness and supports more inclusive and transparent communication. Whether it’s a team discussion, classroom setting, or boardroom meeting, this mode ensures that all participants—regardless of their position in the room—are visible at all times. It serves as an ideal default view before transitioning into more focused or interactive modes, such as speaker tracking or presentation layouts. By showing the entire environment in real time, Original Mode helps users feel more connected and aware during collaborative sessions.
